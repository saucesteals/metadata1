# metadata1

## For Educational Purposes ONLY

This is a template repository for creating a metadata1 generator\
It's intention is to show what metadata1 is and how its payloads are structured and created

## Notes

- Even though it is possible to generate "valid" payloads with the hardcoded example data that is in the repo, you shouldn't rely on it always working
- The code is very self-explanatory, but additional documentation may be added in the future
